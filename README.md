# Numerical-ODES
Solving Numerical Differential Equations (Python)
Scripts to solve Numerical DEs (First Order yet).
The Initial values are set to U[0] = 1
You can edit the scripts to prompt for a different conditions.
I am still constructing one for implicit Runge-kutta methods. Please ignore the 
exact_solution() its just our class assignment. You can redefine for x and y 
or whatever variables and also redefine exact solutions
